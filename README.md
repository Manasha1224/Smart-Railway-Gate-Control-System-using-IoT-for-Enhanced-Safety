# Smart-Railway-Gate-Control-System-using-IoT-for-Enhanced-Safety
This project presents a Smart Railway Gate Control System using IoT to improve safety at railway level crossings. The system automatically detects train arrival and departure using ultrasonic sensors and controls the gate using a servo motor. Real-time alerts and monitoring are provided through the Blynk IoT application.
